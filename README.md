# HyperLedger-Fabric-App
Created a MarketPlace Use case using IBM Hyperledger Fabric 

# Inspiration:
* CraigList.
* The Distibuted Ledger Technology to have single Ledger distributed over the various nodes.This single ledger helps in deriving the history of the commodity and its flow between the different ownerships.
* Similar Use case implemented in Ethereum Platform

# What it does:
* The purpose of the DApp is to buy and sell commodities between the different accounts.
* Different Account holders can be created using the Metamask interface.
* Also the event monitoring process in order to maintain the single ledger for transactions.

# Challenges:
* Cloud setup and its Integration
* Security certification problems using local instances and docker images
* Docker Images management
* Angular Js Integration
# Implementation:
* **Docker**  - Run the Hyper Ledger Fabric Peer
* **Hyperledger Composer** - To define the Business Network definitions (Model files, Logic Javascript, Access Control List)
* **Composer Rest Server** -  To create the REST API Interface to the Hyperledger Application
* **Angular Front End** -  To Interact with expose REST API. 
  
# Build With:
* Hyperledger Fabric, Composer, Docker, Node.js, Angular.js, Docker, REST, Shell script, Bluemix.
